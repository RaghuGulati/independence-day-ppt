### What is AI?


### History
The idea of AI was coined by John Mccarthy in 1955 at Dartmouth Conference. For this very reason, Mccarthy is regarded as father of AI.


#### Definition of AI by Mccarthy: 
Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulateit. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves.



### What is AI?
AI machine is basically a machine with the ability to solve problems that are usually done by humans with their natural intelligence and mind applications.
