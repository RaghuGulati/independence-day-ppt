Honourable Prime Minister Narinder Modi wants to strengthen the country economically by creating second swadeshi movement. Actually, the entire world economy has collapsed due to corona virus. In such a situation, once again Prime Minister Narinder Modi has given the mantra to people to be vocal to make global with the use of more and more local items to make the country self-sufficient.

In a country with the population of 130 crores, if the situation worsens due to corona, then the country will have to suffer even greater economic loss. Perhaps sensing the same situation, the Prime Minister of the country has said that the local products will be given due consideration. 



He has not only asked the country man to use the local product but has also urged to publicize it and make it global. The Prime Minister has announced an economic package of Rs twenty lac crores to improve the situation. There is a big thinking behind this. Due great usage of foreign products, domestic companies could not progress further. There are better quality indigenous products. Such products are



<b>Toothpaste </b>

Foreign Companies are suppling salt to us. Apart from this, the market of biscuits and chocolate has always been occupied by foreign companies, which we also use a lot in our homes. Therefore it is not difficult to understand that the Prime Minister has given the local, why there is talk of global. 



If we as responsible citizens of India pledge on this Independent day to start using indigenous or local products, then not only will India be Financially strong, but there will be a change in the standard of living of the people of India.
